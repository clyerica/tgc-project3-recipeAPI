# Recipes API Summary
## Context 

This project is created as an api for cooks who want to find share recipes. As a repository, it allows categorisation by course, serving size, type of cuisine and dietary restriction, etc. Users can search for recipes to suit their needs and add reviews to the recipes to let other users know if a recipe is good or not. 

The API was created on MongoDB and hosted on Heroku

## User Goals
* As a cook, I want to find recipes by course to find appropriate recipes to cater to a specific event (e.g. snack, drink, dinner, dessert).

* As a cook, I want to find recipes that are appropriate for particular dietary restrictions (e.g. vegan, kosher).
* As a cook, I want to find recipes by cuisine so I can cook learn a particular style of cooking (e.g. italian, chinese, etc).
* As a cook using the website, I want to leave reviews on the recipes to let others know if it was good.
* As a cook using the website, I want to update or delete my reviews if I change my mind about the review.
* As a cook using the website, I want to see reviews other people have left on the recipe, to see if it is worth making.
* As a cook, I want to be able to update or delete recipes I have posted if I improve or no longer like the recipe.
